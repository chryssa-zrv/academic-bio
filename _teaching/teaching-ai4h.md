Taught the practical sessions at the AI4Health winter school titled "Biomedical Text Mining: methods, tools and applications". Co-organised with [Fenia Christopoulou](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fenchri?originalSubdomain=uk)


### Abstract: Biomedical Text Mining and Natural Language Processing (BioNLP) are important areas of AI that can assist health experts in biomedical research. The large amount of freely available biomedical text has made BioNLP techniques particularly attractive and useful for clinicians, via methods for automatic knowledge extraction and discovery. Typically, mining knowledge from biomedicine is considered much harder than other types of text due to the expertise required. The goal of this tutorial is to provide the participants with a hands-on overview of the main downstream tasks and applications of biomedical NLP and how these can be used to construct useful tools for biomedical research.

The session will cover three parts:

(i) Overview of key tasks and their variations depending on the target resources and domain of interest (clinical trials, scientific literature, ontologies, etc), along with a synopsis of the most established NLP techniques in the field,

(ii) Exploration of specific use cases on NaCTeM tools that will allow users to appreciate the potential of combining multiple NLP tasks in order to extract structured information and navigate vast amounts of text. Participants will learn how to use such tools in order to accelerate/facilitate their research,

(iii) Testing and comparing existing NLP models to achieve complex information extraction on biomedical datasets.

The participants will be able to build incrementally a text mining workflow that will combine a series of NLP tasks, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), Relation Extraction (RE), Event Extraction (EE), metaknowledge identification and visualise the output using the brat (https://brat.nlplab.org/) annotation platform. Through experimentation with these modules they will get the chance to examine different deep learning architectures, and appreciate the impact of different training and fine-tuning setups on the performance of the models, depending on the target domain/task. After the tutorial, the participants should be aware of the importance of biomedical NLP in supporting researchers and practitioners in the health and biomedical domains. In addition, they should be able to understand how existing text mining systems work, on what features they rely on as well as remaining challenges. Participants would have an overview of currently available tools and techniques and how to implement and use biomedical NLP applications in practice.
